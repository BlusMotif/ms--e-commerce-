# Notification Center - View Order Navigation Fix

## Issue
When customers tap "View Order" in the notification center, it should navigate them to their orders page where they can see all their orders.

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

**File**: `src/pages/NotificationsPage.jsx`

**1. Added Link Import**
```jsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
```

**2. Updated View Order Link**
Changed from `<a>` tag to `<Link>` component with smart navigation:

```jsx
<Link
  to={role === 'customer' ? '/customer/orders' : notification.metadata.orderLink}
  className="inline-flex items-center text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 font-medium text-sm mt-2"
  onClick={() => handleMarkAsRead(notification.id, notification.source)}
>
  View Order â†’
</Link>
```

### How It Works

**Smart Navigation by Role:**

1. **Customers** (`role === 'customer'`)
   - Always navigate to: `/customer/orders`
   - This is the "My Orders" page
   - Shows all customer's orders in one place
   - Customer can view order details from there

2. **Admins/Agents** (other roles)
   - Navigate to: `notification.metadata.orderLink`
   - Usually links to specific admin/agent order pages
   - Maintains existing behavior for staff

### Additional Enhancement

**Auto-Mark as Read:**
- When customer clicks "View Order", the notification is automatically marked as read
- Uses: `onClick={() => handleMarkAsRead(notification.id, notification.source)}`
- Better user experience - notification badge updates immediately

## User Experience

### Before
- Customer taps "View Order" in notification
- Opens external link or broken link
- Customer confused about where to go

### After
- Customer taps "View Order" in notification
- âœ… Navigates to `/customer/orders` (My Orders page)
- âœ… Notification marked as read automatically
- âœ… Customer sees all their orders
- âœ… Can view specific order details from there

## Technical Details

### Route Structure
- **Customer Orders Page**: `/customer/orders`
- **Component**: `CustomerOrders.jsx`
- **Protected Route**: Yes (requires customer login)

### Navigation Flow
1. Customer receives order notification
2. Opens notification center
3. Sees notification about order
4. Clicks "View Order â†’"
5. React Router navigates to `/customer/orders`
6. Notification marked as read
7. Customer sees their orders page

### Role-Based Routing
```javascript
const getOrderLink = (role, notification) => {
  if (role === 'customer') {
    return '/customer/orders';  // Always go to My Orders
  } else {
    return notification.metadata.orderLink;  // Admin/Agent specific link
  }
};
```

## Benefits

### User Experience
- âœ… Clear navigation path
- âœ… Consistent behavior
- âœ… No broken links
- âœ… Auto-marks as read

### Technical
- âœ… Uses React Router (no page reload)
- âœ… Maintains SPA behavior
- âœ… Role-based routing
- âœ… Clean code with Link component

### Maintenance
- âœ… Easy to update routes
- âœ… Centralized navigation logic
- âœ… Type-safe routing
- âœ… No hardcoded URLs

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. No Order Link
```jsx
{notification.metadata?.orderLink && (
  <Link>...</Link>
)}
```
- Only shows link if orderLink exists
- Safe navigation

### 2. Missing Role
```jsx
role === 'customer' ? '/customer/orders' : notification.metadata.orderLink
```
- Defaults to metadata link if role undefined
- Prevents errors

### 3. Announcement Notifications
```jsx
onClick={() => handleMarkAsRead(notification.id, notification.source)}
```
- Only marks user notifications as read
- Announcements remain unread (system-wide)

### 4. Already Read Notifications
- Link still works
- Can revisit orders page
- No errors if already read
