# Background Notification System

## Problem
Mobile browsers don't allow audio to play when the app is running in the background or when the screen is off. This prevents admins and agents from hearing notification sounds for new orders.

## Solution
Implemented a multi-layered notification system that works even when the app is in the background:

### 1. Browser Notifications (Primary - Background Support)
### 2. Vibration API (Mobile Devices)
### 3. Audio Alerts (When App is Active)

---

## Features Implemented

### 🔔 Browser Notifications
**Works in Background: YES**

- Native browser notifications that appear even when:
  - App is minimized
  - Browser tab is in background
  - Phone screen is locked (on some devices)
  - User is in a different app

**Capabilities**:
- Shows notification badge on app icon
- Displays notification in system tray
- Plays system notification sound
- Vibrates device (if supported)
- Persists until user interacts
- Renotifies even if notification exists

**Configuration**:
```javascript
{
  icon: '/favicon.svg',              // MS Special logo
  badge: '/favicon.svg',             // App badge icon
  vibrate: [200, 100, 200],         // Vibration pattern
  requireInteraction: true,          // Stay until clicked
  tag: 'order-notification',         // Prevent duplicates
  renotify: true                     // Alert again
}
```

### 📳 Vibration API
**Works in Background: PARTIAL**

- Vibrates mobile device when notification arrives
- Works when app is in foreground
- May work when app is in recent apps (device-dependent)
- Does not work when app is fully closed

**Vibration Pattern**:
- `[200, 100, 200, 100, 200]` - Strong, noticeable pattern
- 200ms vibrate, 100ms pause, repeat

### 🔊 Audio Alerts
**Works in Background: NO**

- Plays when app is active and visible
- Automatically switches to notifications when app goes to background
- High volume for audibility

---

## How It Works

### Smart Detection System

```javascript
if (document.hidden) {
  // App in background
  → Show browser notification
  → Vibrate device
} else {
  // App in foreground
  → Play audio sound
  → Vibrate device
  → Show browser notification
}
```

### Notification Loop (Every 5 seconds)

**When App Active:**
1. Play audio sound (ascending chimes)
2. Vibrate device
3. Show notification (as backup)

**When App in Background:**
1. Show browser notification with sound
2. Vibrate device (if supported)
3. Display banner with order details

---

## User Experience

### First Time Setup

**Step 1: Enable Sounds**
- User clicks "Sound On" button in dashboard
- System requests notification permission

**Step 2: Grant Permission**
Browser shows: _"Allow [domain] to send notifications?"_
- User clicks "Allow"
- System shows confirmation notification

**Step 3: Enjoy Notifications**
- New orders trigger notifications automatically
- Works even when app is minimized

### Daily Usage

**App in Foreground:**
- 🔊 Audio sound plays
- 📳 Device vibrates
- 🔔 Notification shows (backup)

**App in Background:**
- 🔔 Browser notification appears
- 📳 Device vibrates
- 🔊 System plays notification sound
- Badge appears on app icon

**App Minimized/Locked Screen:**
- 🔔 Notification banner slides down
- 📳 Device vibrates
- 🔊 System notification sound plays
- 📱 Wake screen (device-dependent)

## Code Changes

### `/src/utils/notificationSound.js`

**New Methods:**

```javascript
// Vibrate device
vibrate(pattern) {
  navigator.vibrate(pattern);
}

// Show browser notification
async showNotification(title, options) {
  await Notification.requestPermission();
  new Notification(title, options);
}

// Enhanced loop with background detection
async startLoop() {
  setInterval(() => {
    if (!document.hidden) {
      // Foreground: play audio
      this.playOrderNotification();
    } else {
      // Background: show notification
      this.showNotification(...);
      this.vibrate(...);
    }
  }, 5000);
}

// Request notification permission
async requestNotificationPermission() {
  return await Notification.requestPermission();
}

// Check capabilities
notificationsAvailable() { ... }
vibrationAvailable() { ... }
```

### `/src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.jsx`

**Enhanced Sound Toggle:**

```javascript
const toggleSound = async () => {
  setSoundEnabled(!soundEnabled);
  
  // Request notification permission
  if ('Notification' in window) {
    const permission = await notificationSound.requestNotificationPermission();
    
    if (permission === 'granted') {
      // Show success notification
      notificationSound.showNotification('Notifications Enabled', {
        body: 'You will receive alerts even in background.'
      });
    } else {
      // Show alert to enable in settings
      alert('Please enable notifications in browser settings.');
    }
  }
};
```

### `/src/pages/agent/AgentDashboard.jsx`

**Same enhancement as AdminDashboard**

---

## Permission Flow

### First Visit
1. User opens dashboard
2. Clicks "Sound On" button
3. Browser requests notification permission
4. User clicks "Allow"
5. Confirmation notification appears
6. System ready for background notifications

### Permission States

**Default (Not Asked)**
- Status: `Notification.permission === 'default'`
- Action: Request permission when user enables sounds
- Result: Show permission prompt

**Granted**
- Status: `Notification.permission === 'granted'`
- Action: Show notifications immediately
- Result: Notifications work in background

**Denied**
- Status: `Notification.permission === 'denied'`
- Action: Show alert with instructions
- Result: User must enable in browser settings

---

## Testing Instructions

### Desktop Testing

**Chrome/Edge:**
1. Open dashboard
2. Enable "Sound On"
3. Allow notifications when prompted
4. Minimize browser window
5. Create test order from another device
6. ✅ Notification should appear on desktop

**Firefox:**
1. Same as Chrome
2. Check notification in system notification center

### Mobile Testing (Android)

**Chrome Android:**
1. Open site on phone
2. Tap anywhere to unlock audio
3. Go to dashboard
4. Enable "Sound On"
5. Tap "Allow" when prompted
6. Lock phone or switch to another app
7. Create test order
8. ✅ Notification should appear on lock screen
9. ✅ Device should vibrate
10. ✅ Sound should play

**Check Notification:**
- Pull down notification drawer
- Notification should be visible
- Tap to open app

### Mobile Testing (iOS)

**Safari iOS (16.4+):**
1. Open site in Safari
2. Tap anywhere to unlock audio
3. Go to dashboard
4. Enable "Sound On"
5. Tap "Allow" for notifications
6. Lock phone or switch apps
7. Create test order
8. ✅ Notification banner should appear
9. ⚠️ May not vibrate (iOS limitation)
10. ✅ Sound should play

**Important**: iOS has stricter background policies. Best results when:

- Device not in Low Power Mode

---

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Showing

**Check 1: Permission**
```javascript
console.log(Notification.permission);
// Should be: "granted"
```

**Check 2: Browser Support**
```javascript
console.log('Notification' in window);
// Should be: true
```

**Check 3: System Settings**
- **Android**: Settings > Apps > Chrome > Notifications > Allowed
- **iOS**: Settings > Safari > Notifications > Allowed
- **Windows**: Settings > System > Notifications > Chrome
- **Mac**: System Preferences > Notifications > Chrome

### Sound Not Playing in Background

**Expected Behavior**: 
- Audio doesn't play in background (browser limitation)
- Browser notification plays system sound instead
- This is normal and by design

**If System Sound Not Playing**:
- Check device volume
- Check notification sound settings
- Test with other apps

### Vibration Not Working

**Android:**
- Check "Vibrate on notification" in system settings
- Ensure device not in silent mode
- Test vibration with other apps

**iOS:**
- Vibration support is limited
- May not work for web notifications
- Consider this a "nice to have"

### iPhone Specific Issues

**iOS 16.3 or Earlier:**
- Web push notifications not supported
- Only PWA notifications work
- Ask user to add site to home screen

**iOS 16.4+:**
- Web notifications supported
- Must be in Safari (not Chrome/Firefox iOS)
- May require site to be "installed"

**Low Power Mode:**
- Notifications may be delayed
- Vibration may not work
- Sound may be quieter

   - Keep in background (recent apps)
   - Better notification reliability

3. **Check Periodically**
   - Open app occasionally
   - Refresh notification permission
   - Ensure still receiving alerts

4. **PWA Installation (Recommended)**
   - Add site to home screen
   - Better background support
   - More reliable notifications
   - Badge on app icon

### For Users (Customers)
