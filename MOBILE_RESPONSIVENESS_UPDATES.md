#### New Features Added:

**Notification Bell Icon:**
- Added Bell icon with unread count badge
- Positioned in header next to user info
- Only visible for admin and agent roles

- Shows top 5 most recent notifications
- Displays notification icon, title, message preview, and date

#### Mobile-Specific Optimizations:

**Responsive Positioning:**
```jsx
// Mobile: Fixed positioning from top
top-16 lg:top-full right-4 lg:right-0

// Width adapts to screen size
w-[calc(100vw-2rem)] lg:w-96 max-w-md
```

**Backdrop for Mobile:**
```jsx
// Dark overlay on mobile only
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-40 lg:hidden" onClick={closeDropdown} />
```

**Max Height:**
```jsx
// Shorter on mobile to prevent off-screen content
max-h-[70vh] lg:max-h-96
```

**Z-Index Management:**
```jsx
// Backdrop: z-40
// Dropdown: z-50
// Ensures proper layering
```
