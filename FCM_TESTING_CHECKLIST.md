## üîç Debugging Tools

### Check Service Worker Registration

Open browser console and run:

```javascript
// Check if service worker is registered
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(regs => {
  console.log('Service Workers:', regs);
  if (regs.length > 0) {
    console.log('‚úÖ Service worker is registered');
  } else {
    console.log('‚ùå No service worker found');
  }
});
```

### Check FCM Token

```javascript
// Check if FCM token was generated
import { getToken } from 'firebase/messaging';
import { messaging } from './src/config/firebase';

getToken(messaging, { 
  vapidKey: 'BBTN9keK6mDsm9WJmtKZL3PSh6WWsAAP1v6br92IB1foEsSszkGaRh5NXPCSyMuY2-ZM5qv4wC0gtf6yPmGH6y8' 
})
.then(token => {
  console.log('‚úÖ FCM Token:', token);
})
.catch(err => {
  console.log('‚ùå Error getting token:', err);
});
```

### Check Notification Permission

```javascript
console.log('Notification Permission:', Notification.permission);
// Should show: "granted"
```

### View FCM Tokens in Database

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Realtime Database
3. Look for path: `/fcmTokens/{userId}`
4. You should see your token stored there

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "FCM not supported" message

**Cause**: Browser doesn't support FCM or HTTPS not enabled

**Fix**:
- Use Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
- Make sure you're on `localhost` (for dev) or HTTPS (for prod)
- Safari has limited support - recommend Chrome

### No notification when screen is off

**Cause**: Service worker not registered or VAPID key missing

**Fix**:
- Check console for service worker errors
- Verify VAPID key in `.env` file
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear browser cache

### "Registration token not registered" error

**Cause**: Token expired or invalid

**Fix**:
- Re-enable notifications (generates new token)
- Check if token exists in database
- Verify Firebase project credentials match

### Notification appears but doesn't open app

**Cause**: Notification click handler issue

**Fix**:
- Check service worker console for errors
- Verify `firebase-messaging-sw.js` is loaded
- Test with browser DevTools open

### Token not saving to database

**Cause**: Database rules or authentication issue

**Fix**:
- Check Firebase Database Rules allow writes to `/fcmTokens`
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check console for permission errors

## üöÄ Next Steps After Testing

1. **If all tests pass**:
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor FCM token generation in database
   - Track notification delivery rates
   - Collect user feedback

2. **If tests fail**:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify service worker registration
   - Confirm VAPID key is correct
   - Review Firebase project settings
   - Test on different browsers/devices

3. **Enhancements to consider**:
   - Add notification preferences page
   - Implement quiet hours
   - Add notification categories
   - Rich notifications with images
   - Action buttons in notifications
